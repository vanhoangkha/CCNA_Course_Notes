# 50. DHCP SNOOPING (LAYER 2)

WHAT IS DHCP SNOOPING?

- DHCP SNOOPING is a security feature of SWITCHES that is used to filter DHCP messages received on UNTRUSTED PORTS
- DHCP SNOOPING only filters DHCP MESSAGES.
    - Non-DHCP MESSAGES are not affected
- All PORTS are UNTRUSTED, by DEFAULT
    - Usually UPLINK PORTS are configured as TRUSTED PORTS, and DOWNLINK PORTS remain UNTRUSTED

ATTACKS ON DHCP

DHCP STARVATION

- An example of a DHCP-based ATTACK is a DHCP STARVATION ATTACK
- An ATTACKER uses spoofed MAC ADDRESSES to flood DHCP DISCOVER messages
- The TARGET server’s DHCP POOL becomes full, resulting in a DoS to other DEVICES

DHCP POISONING (Man-in-the-Middle)

- Similar to ARP POISONING, DHCP POISONING can be used to perform a Man-in-the-Middle ATTACK
- A *spurious DHCP SERVER* replies to CLIENTS’ DHCP Discover messages and assigns them IP ADDRESSES but makes the CLIENTS use the *spurious SERVER’S IP* as a DEFAULT GATEWAY

** CLIENTS usually accept the first DHCP OFFER message they receive

- This will cause the CLIENT to send TRAFFIC to the ATTACKER instead of the legitimate DEFAULT GATEWAY
- The ATTACKER can then examine / modify the TRAFFIC before forwarding it to the legitimate DEFAULT GATEWAY

DHCP MESSAGES

- When DHCP SNOOPING filters messages, it differentiates between DHCP SERVER messages and DHCP CLIENT messages

- Messages sent by DHCP SERVERS:
    - OFFER
    - ACK
    - NAK = Opposite of ACK - used to DECLINE a CLIENT’S REQUEST
- Messages sent by DHCP CLIENTS:
    - DISCOVER
    - REQUEST
    - RELEASE = Used to tell the SERVER that the CLIENT no longer needs its IP ADDRESS
    - DECLINE = Used to DECLINE the IP ADDRESS offered by a DHCP SERVER

---

HOW DOES IT WORK?

- If a DHCP MESSAGE is received on a TRUSTED PORT, forward it as normal without inspection
- If a DHCP MESSAGE is received on an UNTRUSTED PORT, inspect it and act as follows:
    - If it is a DHCP SERVER message, discard it
    - If it as a DHCP CLIENT message, perform the following checks:
        - DISCOVER / REQUEST messages :
            - Check if the FRAME’S SOURCE MAC ADDRESS and the DHCP MESSAGE’S CHADDR FIELDS match.
                - MATCH = FORWARD
                - MISMATCH = DISCARD
        - RELEASE / DECLINE messages:
            - Check if the PACKET’S SOURCE IP ADDRESS and the receiving INTERFACE match the entry in the *DHCP SNOOPING BINDING TABLE*
                - MATCH = FORWARD
                - MISMATCH = DISCARD
    
- When a CLIENT successfully leases an IP ADDRESS from a SERVER, create a new entry in the *DHCP SNOOPING BINDING TABLE*

DHCP SNOOPING CONFIGURATION

SWITCH 2’s CONFIGURATION

SWITCH 1’s CONFIGURATION

DHCP SNOOPING RATE-LIMITING

- DHCP SNOOPING can limit the RATE at which DHCP messages are allowed to enter an INTERFACE
- If the RATE of DHCP messages crosses the configured LIMIT, the INTERFACE is `err-disabled`
- Like with PORT SECURITY, the interface can be manually re-enabled, or automatically re-enabled with `errdisable recovery`

[Image removed]

- You wouldn’t set the limit rate to 1 since it’s so low, it would shut the port immediately but this shows how RATE-LIMITING works

`errdisable recovery cause dhcp-rate-limit`

DHCP OPTION 82 (INFORMATION OPTION)

- OPTION 82, also known as a ‘DHCP RELAY AGENT INFOMRATION OPTION’ is one of MANY DHCP OPTIONS
- It provides additional information about which DHCP RELAY AGENT received the CLIENT’S message, on which INTERFACE, in which VLAN, etc.
- DHCP RELAY AGENTS can add OPTION 82 to message they forward to the remote DHCP SERVER
- With DHCP SNOOPING enabled, by default Cisco SWITCHES will add OPTION 82 to DHCP messages they receive from CLIENTS, even if the SWITCH isn’t acting as a DHCP RELAY AGENT
- By DEFAULT, Cisco SWITCHES will drop DHCP MESSAGES with OPTION 82 that are received on an UNTRUSTED PORT

THIS command disables OPTION 82 for SW1 but NOT SW2 

[Image removed]

TRAFFIC gets passed to R1 and is DROPPED because of “inconsistent relay information” (packet contains OPTION 82 but wasn’t dropped by SW2)

[Image removed]

By ENABLING OPTION 82 on both SWITCHES…

[Image removed]

PC1’s DHCP DISCOVER message gets passed, through SW1 and SW2, to R1.
R1 responds with an DHCP OFFER message, as normal
