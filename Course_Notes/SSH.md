LAYER 2 SWITCH MANAGEMENT IP

- LAYER 2 SWITCHES do not perform PACKET ROUTING and build a ROUTING TABLE. They are NOT IP ROUTING aware
- However, you CAN assign an IP ADDRESS to an SVI to allow REMOTE CONNECTIONS to the CLI of the SWITCH (using Telnet or SSH)

- TELNET has been largely REPLACE by SSH, which is MORE Secure
- TELNET sends data in PLAIN TEXT. NO ENCRYPTION(!)

SSH

- SSH (Secure Shell) was developed in 1995 to REPLACE LESS SECURE PROTOCOLS, like TELNET
- SSHv2, a major revision of SSHv1, was released in 2006
- If a DEVICE supports both v1 and v2, it is said to run â€˜version 1.99â€™
- Provides SECURITY features; such as DATA ENCRYPTION and AUTHENTICATION
