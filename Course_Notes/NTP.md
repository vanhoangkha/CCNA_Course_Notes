# 37. NTP

WHY IS TIME IMPORTANT FOR NETWORK DEVICES?

- All DEVICES have an INTERNAL CLOCK (ROUTERS, SWITCHES, PCs, etc)
- In CISCO IOS, you can view the time with the `show clock` command

[Image removed]

- If you use the `show clock detail` command, you can see the TIME SOURCE

[Image removed]

- The INTERNAL HARDWARE CLOCK of a DEVICE will ‚Äúdrift‚Äô over time, so it‚Äôs NOT the ideal time source.
- From a CCNA perspective, the most important reason to have accurate time on a DEVICE is to have ACCURATE logs for troubleshooting

- **Syslog**, the protocol used to keep device logs, will be covered in a later video

Command: `show logging`

Note : R3‚Äôs time stamp is completely different than R2‚Äôs !!!

MANUAL TIME CONFIGURATION

- You can manually configure the TIME on the DEVICE with the `clock set` command

[Image removed]

- Although the HARDWARE CALENDAR (built-in clock) is the DEFAULT time-source, the HARDWARE CLOCK and SOFTWARE CLOCK are separate and can be configured separately.

---

HARDWARE CLOCK (CALENDAR) CONFIGURATION

- You can MANUALLY configure the HARDWARE CLOCK with the `calendar set` command

[Image removed]

- Typically, you will want to SYNCHRONIZE the ‚Äòclock‚Äô and ‚Äòcalendar‚Äô
- Use the command `clock update-calendar` to sync the calendar to the clock‚Äôs time
- Use the command `clock read-calendar` to sync the clock to the calendar‚Äôs time

CONFIGURING THE TIME ZONE

- You can configure the time zone with the `clock timezone` command

DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME (SUMMER TIME)

[Image removed]

[Image removed]

Full command :

`R1(config)# clock summer-time EDT recurring 2 Sunday March 02:00 1 Sunday November 02:00`

This covers the START of Daylight Savings and the end of Daylight Savings

NTP BASICS

- Manually configuring the time on DEVICES is NOT Scalable
- The manually configured clocks will ‚Äúdrift‚Äù, resulting in inaccurate time
- NTP (Network Time Protocol) allows AUTOMATIC synchronization of TIME over a NETWORK
- NTP CLIENTS request the TIME from NTP SERVERS
- A DEVICE can be an NTP SERVER and an NTP CLIENT at the same time
- NTP allows accuracy of TIME with ~1 millisecond if the NTP SERVER is in the same LAN - OR within ~50 milliseconds if connecting to the NTP SERVER over a WAN / the INTERNET
- Some NTP SERVERS are ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than others. The ‚Äòdistance‚Äô of an NTP SERVER from the original **reference clock** is called **stratum**

<aside>
üí° NTP uses UDP port 123 to communicate

</aside>

REFERENCE CLOCK

- A REFERENCE CLOCK is usually a VERY accurate time device like an ATOMIC CLOCK or GPS CLOCK
- REFERENCE CLOCKS are **stratum 0** within the NTP hierarchy
- NTP SERVERS directly connected to REFERENCE CLOCKS are **stratum 1**

(Peering with Devices is called ‚Ä¶)

- An NTP CLIENT can SYNC to MULTIPLE NTP SERVERS

NTP CONFIGURATION

[Image removed]

Using key argument ‚Äúprefer‚Äù makes a given server the PREFERRED SERVER

(To show configuration servers)

[Image removed]

`sys.peer` = This is the SERVER that the current ROUTER (R1) is being synchronized to

`st` = Stratum Tier

(To show NTP Status)

[Image removed]

`stratum 2` because it‚Äôs synchronizing from Google (stratum 1)

(To show NTP clock details)

[Image removed]

This command configures the ROUTER to update the HARDWARE CLOCK (Calendar) with the time learned via NTP

`R1(config)# ntp update-calendar` 

The HARDWARE CLOCK tracks the DATE and TIME on the DEVICE - even if it restarts, power is lost, etc.

When the SYSTEM is restarted, the HARDWARE CLOCK is used to INITIALIZE the SOFTWARE CLOCK

CONFIGURE A LOOPBACK INTERFACE FOR AN NTP SERVER

[Image removed]

Why configure a LOOPBACK DEVICE on R1 for NTP ?

If one of R1‚Äôs ROUTER INTERFACES goes down, it will still be accessible via R3‚Äôs ROUTING path

[Image removed]

SET NTP SERVER for R2 using the LOOPBACK INTERFACE on R1

[Image removed]

SETTING R3 NTP SOURCE SERVERS using R1 and R2

[Image removed]

NOTE : R1 has PREFERENCE because it‚Äôs STRATUM TIER is HIGHER than R2s

CONFIGURE NTP AUTHENTICATION

- NTP AUTHENTICATION can be configured, although it is OPTIONAL
- It allows NTP CLIENTS to ensure they only sync to the intended SERVERS
- To CONFIGURE NTP AUTHENTICATION:
    - `ntp authenticate` (Enables NTP AUTHENTICATION)
    - `ntp authenticate-key *key-number* md5 *key*` (Create the NTP AUTHENTICATION Key(s))
    - `ntp trusted-key *key-number`* (Specify the Trusted Key(s))
    - `ntp server *ip-address* key *key-number`* (Specify which key to use for the server)
