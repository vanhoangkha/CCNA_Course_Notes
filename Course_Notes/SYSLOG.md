# 41. SYSLOG

SYSLOG OVERVIEW

- SYSLOG is an INDUSTRY-STANDARD PROTOCOL for message logging
- On NETWORK DEVICES, SYSLOG can be used to LOG EVENTS
    - Changes in INTERFACE status (UP / DOWN)
    - Changes in OSFP NEIGHBOUR STATUS (UP / DOWN)
    - System Restarts
    - etcâ€¦
- The messages can be displayed in the CLI, saved in the DEVICEâ€™S RAM or sent to an external SYSLOG SERVER

- Logs are essential when troubleshooting issues, examining the cause of incidents, etc.
- SYSLOG and SNMP are both used for MONITORING and TROUBLESHOOTING of DEVICES. They are complementary, but their functionalities are different

SYSLOG MESSAGE FORMAT

`seq: time stamp: %facility-severity-MNEMONIC:description`

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ These TWO FIELDS may or may not be displayed, depending on the DEVICEâ€™S configuration

</aside>

`seq` = A SEQUENCE NUMBER indicating the order / sequence of messages

`time stamp` = A TIMESTAMP indicating the time the message was generated

`facility` = A VALUE that indicates which process on the DEVICE generated the message

`severity` = A NUMBER that indicates the severity of a logged event.

Official RFC for SYSLOG severity levels

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ LEVELS and KEYWORDS need to be MEMORIZED for the CCNA

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ MEMORIZATION MNEMONIC : 
(E)very (A)wesome (C)isco (E)ngineer (W)ill (N)eed (I)ce cream (D)aily

</aside>

`MNEMONIC` = A SHORT CODE for the message, indicating what happened

`description` = Detailed information about the EVENT being reported

SYSLOG LOGGING LOCATIONS

- **CONSOLE LINE**
    - SYSLOG messages will be displayed in the CLI when connected to the DEVICE via the CONSOLE port. By DEFAULT, all messages (Level 0-7) are displayed
- **BUFFER**
    - Syslog messages will be saved to RAM. By default, ALL messages (Level 0-7) are displayed
- **VTY LINES**
    - SYSLOG messages will be displayed in the CLI when connected to the DEVICE via Telnet/SSH (coming in a later video). Disabled by default.

- **EXTERNAL SERVER**
    - You can configure the DEVICE to send SYSLOG messages to an external server

** SYSLOG SERVERS will listen for messages on UDP PORT 514 **

SYSLOG CONFIGURATION

[Image removed]

`level` works from the chosen level and upward toward Level 0 (EMERGENCY)

`level` or `keyword` from the Severity Table works when choosing a level

TERMINAL MONITOR

- Even if `logging monitor level` is enabled, by default SYSLOG messages will not be displayed when connected via Telnet or SSH
- For the messages to be displayed, you must use the following command:
    - `R1# terminal monitor`
- The command must be used **every time you connect to the DEVICE via Telnet or SSH**

LOGGING SYNCHRONOUS

- By default, logging messages displayed in the CLI while you are in the middle of typing a command will result in something like this:

- To prevent this, you should use `logging synchronous` on the appropriate *line*

[Image removed]

- This will cause a new line to be printed if your typing is interrupted by a message

SYSLOG versus SNMP

- SYSLOG and SNMP are both used for MONITORING and TROUBLESHOOTING of DEVICES. They are COMPLIMENTARY, but their FUNCTIONALITIES are different.

- SYSLOG
    - Used for MESSAGE LOGGING
    - Events that occur within the system are categorized based on FACILITY / SEVERITY and LOGGED
    - Used for SYSTEM MANAGEMENT, ANALYSIS, and TROUBLESHOOTING
    - Messages are sent from the DEVICES to the SERVER.
        - The SERVER canâ€™t actively pull information from the DEVICES (like SNMP â€˜getâ€™) or modify variables (like SNMP â€˜setâ€™)
- SNMP
    - Used to retrieve and organize information about the SNMP managed DEVICES
        - IP ADDRESSES
        - Current INTERFACE status
        - Temperature
        - CPU Usage
        - etcâ€¦
    - SNMP SERVERS can use `Get` to query the CLIENTS and `Set` to MODIFY variables on the CLIENTS
