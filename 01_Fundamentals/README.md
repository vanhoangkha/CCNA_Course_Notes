# 🌟 Fundamentals

**Foundation concepts you must master first**

This section covers the essential networking fundamentals that form the foundation of all networking knowledge. Master these concepts before moving to more advanced topics.

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **[Network Devices](./Network_Devices.md)** - Routers, switches, hubs, and other network equipment
2. **[Interfaces and Cables](./Interfaces_and_Cables.md)** - Physical connections and cable types
3. **[OSI Model and TCP/IP Suite](./OSI_Model_TCPSuite.md)** - Network layering and protocols
4. **[Intro to CLI](./Intro_to_CLI.md)** - Command line interface basics
5. **[The IPv4 Header](./The_IPv4_Header.md)** - IPv4 packet structure and fields
6. **[TCP and UDP](./TCP_and_UDP.md)** - Transport layer protocols
7. **[Life of a Packet](./Life_of_a_Packet.md)** - How data travels through networks

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you should understand:
- Basic network devices and their functions
- Physical layer connections and cabling
- The OSI model and TCP/IP stack
- Basic Cisco CLI navigation
- IPv4 packet structure
- Transport layer protocols (TCP/UDP)
- End-to-end packet flow

## ⏰ Estimated Study Time
**2-3 weeks** - Take your time with these fundamentals as they support everything else you'll learn.

## 📝 Study Tips
- Draw network diagrams as you learn
- Practice CLI commands in a lab environment
- Understand the OSI model thoroughly - it's referenced throughout the course
- Focus on understanding concepts, not just memorizing
