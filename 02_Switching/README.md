# üîÄ Switching

**Layer 2 switching and VLANs**

This section covers Ethernet switching, VLANs, and Layer 2 protocols. These concepts are heavily tested on the CCNA exam.

## üìö Topics Covered

1. **[Ethernet LAN Switching - Part 1](./Ethernet_LAN_Switching_Part1.md)** - Basic switching concepts
2. **[Ethernet LAN Switching - Part 2](./Ethernet_LAN_Switching_Part2.md)** - Advanced switching features
3. **[Switch Interfaces](./Switch_Interfaces.md)** - Interface configuration and management
4. **[VLANs - Part 1](./VLAN_Part1.md)** - VLAN basics and configuration
5. **[VLANs - Part 2](./VLAN_Part2.md)** - VLAN trunking and inter-VLAN routing
6. **[VLANs - Part 3](./VLAN_Part3.md)** - Advanced VLAN concepts
7. **[DTP / VTP](./DTP_VTP.md)** - Dynamic Trunking and VLAN Trunking Protocol
8. **[Spanning Tree Protocol - Part 1](./Spanning_Tree_Protocol_Part1.md)** - STP basics
9. **[Spanning Tree Protocol - Part 2](./Spanning_Tree_Protocol_Part2.md)** - STP operation and configuration
10. **[Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol](./Rapid_Spanning_Tree_Protocol.md)** - RSTP improvements
11. **[EtherChannel](./Etherchannel.md)** - Link aggregation

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you should understand:
- How Ethernet switches operate
- MAC address learning and forwarding
- VLAN concepts and configuration
- Trunking protocols (802.1Q, ISL)
- Spanning Tree Protocol operation
- EtherChannel configuration and benefits

## ‚è∞ Estimated Study Time
**2-3 weeks** - VLANs and STP are critical exam topics.

## üìù Study Tips
- Practice VLAN configuration extensively
- Understand STP root bridge election process
- Draw STP topology diagrams
- Lab practice is essential for this section
