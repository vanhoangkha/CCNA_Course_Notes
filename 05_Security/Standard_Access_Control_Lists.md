# 34. STANDARD ACCESS CONTROL LISTS (ACL)

WHAT ARE ACLs

- ACLs (Access Control Lists) have multiple uses
- In DAY 34 and DAY 35, we will focus on ACL‚Äôs from a security perspective
- ACLs function as a ‚Äúpacket filter‚Äù - instructing the ROUTER to ALLOW or DENY specific traffic
- ACLs can filter traffic based on:
    - SOURCE / DESTINATION IP ADDRESSES
    - SOURCE / DESTINATION LAYER 4 PORTS
    - etc.

HOW ACLs WORK

üìä **[Diagram]** - *Network diagram illustrating the concept*

<aside>
üí° REQUIREMENTS:

- Hosts in 192.168.1.0/24 should have ACCESS to the 10.0.1.0/24 NETWORK
- Hosts in 192.168.2.0/24 should not have ACCESS to the 10.0.10/24 NETWORK
</aside>

ACLs are configured GLOBALLY on the ROUTER (Global Config Mode)

- They are an ordered sequence of ACEs (Access Control Entries)

üìä **[Diagram]** - *Network diagram illustrating the concept*

- Configuring an ACL in Global Config Mode will not make the ACL take effect
- The ACL must be applied to an interface
    - ACLs are applied either INBOUND or OUTBOUND
- ACLs are made up of one or more ACEs
- When a ROUTER checks a PACKET against the ACL, it processes the ACEs in order, from top to bottom
- If the PACKET matches one of the ACEs in the ACL, the ROUTER takes the action and stops processing the ACL. All entries below the matching entry will be ignored

IMPLICIT DENY

- What will happen if a PACKET doesn‚Äôt match any of the entries in an ACL ?
- There is an INPLICIT DENY at the end of ALL ACL‚Äôs
- The IMPLICIT DENY tells the ROUTER to DENY ALL TRAFFIC that doesn‚Äôt match ANY of the configured entries in the ACL

ACL TYPES

üìä **[Diagram]** - *Network diagram illustrating the concept*

---

STANDARD NUMBERED ACLs

- Match traffic based only on the SOURCE IP ADDRESS of the PACKET
- Numbered ACLs are identified with a number (ie: ACL 1, ACL 2, etc.)
- Different TYPES of ACLs have a different range of numbers that can be used
    
    <aside>
    üí° STANDARD ACLs can use 1-99 and 1300-1999
    
    </aside>
    

- The basic command to configure a STANDARD NUMBERED ACL
    - `R1(config)# access-list *number* {deny | permit} *ip wildcard-mask*`
    
    This is an example of denying a SPECIFIC host‚Äôs traffic
    
    REMEMBER : 0.0.0.0 wildcard is the same as 255.255.255.255 or a /32 host
    
    - Example : `R1(config)# access-list 1 deny 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0`
    - Example : `R1(config)# access-list 1 deny 1.1.1.1`(identical to the above)
    - Example : `R1(config)# access-list 1 deny host 1.1.1.1`
    
    If you want to permit ANY traffic from ANY source
    
    - Example : `R1(config)# access-list 1 permit any`
    - Example : `R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255`
    
    If you want to make a description for a specific ACL
    
    - Example : `R1(config)# access-list 1 remark ## BLOCK BOB FROM ACCOUNTING ##`

Order is important. Lower Numbers are processed FIRST

TO APPLY AN ACL TO AN INTERFACE

`R1(config-if)# ip access-group *number* {in | out}`

üìä **[Diagram]** - *Network diagram illustrating the concept*

WHY WAS THIS RULE PLACED ON G0/2 OUT ? 

<aside>
üí° STANDARD ACLs should be applied as CLOSE to the DESTINATION as possible!

</aside>

---

STANDARD NAMED ACLs

- Standard ACLs match traffic based only on the SOURCE IP ADDRESS of the PACKET
- NAMED ACLs are identified with a NAME (ie: ‚ÄòBLOCK_BOB‚Äô)
- STANDARD NAMED ACLs are configured by entering ‚Äòstandard named ACL config mode‚Äô then configuring EACH entry within that config mode
    - `R1(config)# ip access-list standard *acl-name*`
    - `R1(config-std-nacl)# [*entry-number*] {deny | permit} *ip wildcard-mask*`

WHY THE REORDERING?

CISCOs PACKET TRACER does not reorder these, however.
