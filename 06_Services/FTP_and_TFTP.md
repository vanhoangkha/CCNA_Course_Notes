# 43. FTP and TFTP

THE PURPOSE OF FTP / TFTP

- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) are INDUSTRY STANDARD PROTOCOLS used to TRANSFER FILES over a NETWORK
- They BOTH use a CLIENT-SERVER model
    - CLIENTS can use FTP / TFTP to COPY files FROM a SERVER
    - CLIENTS can use FTP / TFTP to COPY files TO a SERVER
- As a NETWORK ENGINEER, the most common use for FTP / TFTP is in the process of UPGRADING the OPERATING SYSTEM of a NETWORK DEVICE
- You can use FTP / TFTP to DOWNLOAD the newer version of IOS from a SERVER and then REBOOT the DEVICE with the new IOS image

TFTP and FTP FUNCTIONS AND DIFFERENCES

TFTP

- TFTP first standardized in 1981
- Named ‚ÄúTrivial‚Äù because it‚Äôs SIMPLE and has only basic features compared to FTP
    - Only allows a CLIENT to COPY FILES to / from a SERVER
- Was released after FTP, but not a REPLACEMENT for FTP.
    - It‚Äôs another tool to use when LIGHTWEIGHT SIMPLICITY is more important than FUNCTIONALITY
- NO AUTHENTICATION (Username / Password) so SERVERS will respond to ALL FTP REQUESTS
- NO ENCRYPTION. All DATA is sent PLAIN TEXT
- Best used in a CONTROLLED environment to transfer SMALL FILES quickly
- TFTP SERVERS listen on UDP PORT 69
- UDP is CONNECTIONLESS and doesn‚Äôt provided RELIABILITY with RETRANSMISSIONS
- However, TFTP has SIMILAR built-in FEATURES within the PROTOCOL itself

TFTP RELIABILITY

- Every TFTP DATA message is ACKNOWLEDGED
    - If the CLIENT is transferring a FILE TO the SERVER, the SERVER will send ACK messages
    - If the SERVER is transferring a FILE TO the CLIENT, the CLIENT will send ACK messages
- TIMERS are used, and if an EXPECTED message isn‚Äôt received in time, the waiting DEVICE will RESEND its previous message.

TFTP ‚ÄúCONNECTIONS‚Äù

TFTP TID (Not in the CCNA exam)

- When the CLIENT sends the FIRST message to the SERVER, the DESTINATION PORT is UDP 69 and the SOURCE PORT is a random EPHEMERAL PORT
- This ‚Äúrandom port‚Äù is called a ‚ÄúTRANSFER IDENTIFIER‚Äù (TID) and identifies the DATA TRANSFER
- The SERVER then also selects a RANDOM TID to use as a SOURCE PORT when it replies, NOT UDP 69
- When the CLIENT sends the NEXT message, the DESTINATION PORT will be the SERVER‚ÄôS TID, NOT UDP 69

UDP PORT 69 (TFTP) is only used at the initial request message

FTP

- FTP was first standardized in 1971
- FTP uses TCP PORTS 20 and 21
- USERNAMES and PASSWORDS are used for AUTHENTICATION, however there is NO ENCRYPTION
- For GREATER security, FTPS (FTP over SSL / TLS) can be used (Upgrade to FTP)
- SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) can also be used for GREATER security (New Protocol)
- FTP is MORE complex than TFTP and ALLOWS not only FILE TRANSFERS but CLIENTS can also:
    - Navigate FILE DIRECTORIES
    - ADD / REMOVE FILES
    - LIST FILES
    - etc‚Ä¶
- The CLIENT sends FTP *commands* to the SERVER to perform these functions

FTP CONTROL CONNECTIONS

- FTP uses TWO TYPES of connections:
    - An FTP CONTROL connection (TCP 21) is established and used to send FTP commands and replies
    - When FILES or DATA are to be transferred, separate FTP DATA (TCP 20) connections are established and terminated as needed

ACTIVE MODE FTP DATA CONNECTIONS

- The DEFAULT method of establishing FTP DATA connections is ACTIVE MODE in which the SERVER initiates the TCP connection.

üìä **[Diagram]** - *Network diagram illustrating the concept*

- In FTP PASSIVE MODE, the CLIENT initiates the DATA connection.
    - This is often necessary when the CLIENT is behind a FIREWALL, which could BLOCK the INCOMING CONNECTION from the SERVER

IOS FILE SYSTEMS

- A FILE SYSTEM is a way of controlling how DATA is STORED and RETRIEVED
- You can VIEW the FILE SYSTEM of a Cisco IOS DEVICE with `show file systems`

USING FTP / TFTP IN IOS

- You can VIEW the current version of IOS with `show version`
